```
$ ./auto_pod ~/your/project/path
```

### clear\_node

`clear_node` is used to delete node in your computer completely.

### dock\_handler

`dock_handler` is actually **not a executable shell script**, it's a bunch of commands with which you can custom your dock, such as change count of icons per column or per row, show only open apps in dock, etc.

### lazygit

### englishpod\_handler

`englishpod_hander` is used for personal use to extract pure text, which can be imported by Numbers, from some .html files. I know it's fairly ugly for now. Better improvement will be made later on. So, tolerate my bad code temperarily, please. :P
